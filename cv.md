**3. About me**
*My main interest in IT is the constantly evolving stack of technologies, which does not stop its development for a minute, which in turn stimulates me to constantly engage in self-development. I love to learn and learn new things. Take classes. The desire to study IT is supported by the desire to realize oneself in this area, and also stimulates the study of the English language.*
